# C Primer Plus - Chapter 11 Exercises and Solutions

This repository contains the Listings, Exercises, and Solutions
for Chapter 11 of C Primer Plus, 5th edition, by Stephen Prata.

I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to
incorporate Git and GitHub into my workflow, so I could give
myself an opportunity to practice the technologies. Second, I
wanted to show my work. That is, I used C and Vim on a Fedora
37 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and 
manage directories and files as I work through Prata's C Primer
Plus textbook.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the solutions
for your consumption and edification.

Technical Notes and Considerations
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and execute the Chapter 11 files, 

    (1) copy the code directly into your
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or text editor 
        such as Vim, Nano, or Emacs, 
    (2) and either build and execute the files in your IDE 
    (3) or use the following command-line scripts:
        
            $ gcc file1 file2 ... filen -o main
            $ ./main

Note: Programs can have one file, two files, three files, and 
      so on and so forth. Just follow the pattern. In addition, 
      programs use main to name the program and ./main to execute
      the program. Programs, can use program for a program name
      and ./program to execute the program, or any other name
      a programmer prefers. Just follow the pattern.
